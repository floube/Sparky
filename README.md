# Sparky: Java Edition!
The Java Edition of the [Sparky Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Sparky) by [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)

Based on [LWJGL 3](http://www.lwjgl.org/). Pieced together with code from Cherno's [live streams](http://www.twitch.tv/thecherno), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98fqE45g3jZA_hLGUrD4bo6_) and [repository](https://github.com/TheCherno/Sparky) of his Sparky Engine series. Still capable of being optimized.
